**ðŸ‘‹ Hello fellow Humans**

**__Translations__**
I am updating [@Waya#0325](https://waya.one) to support multiple languages.. <br />
So what does that mean to you? It means that you can translate texts __with the template__ that I'll always post here, you **should never** change the first row of the JSON data. 

**Know your languages!** Please note that you should be able to <br />
know English and the language you want to translate into.

**For submission**, please got to the github.com repository and fork the it, <br />
in your fork you can take changes, if you **open a pull request**, <br />
please **note all changes** you have made (in the pull request template). <br />
Thank you!

**__Keep on topic__**
For discussions about Translations, **please use [#ãƒ»developers](https://waya.one/go/discord)**, <br />
use the repository only to submit/update texts! Thank you!
